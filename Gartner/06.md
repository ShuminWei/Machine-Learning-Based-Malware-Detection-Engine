- Enterprises are overly dependent on blocking and prevention mechanisms that are decreasingly effective against advanced attacks. Comprehensive protection requires an adaptive protection process integrating predictive, preventive, detective and response capabilities.



### Key Challenges
- Existing blocking and prevention capabilities are insuf cient to protect against motivated, advanced attackers.
- Most organizations continue to overly invest in prevention-only strategies.
- Detective, preventive, response and predictive capabilities from vendors have been delivered in nonintegrated silos, increasing costs and decreasing their effectiveness.
- Information security doesn't have the continuous visibility it needs to detect advanced attacks.
- Because enterprise systems are under continuous attack and are continuously compromised, an ad hoc approach to "incident response" is the wrong mindset.

### Recommendations
Information security architects:
- Shift your security mindset from "incident response" to "continuous response," wherein systems are assumed to be compromised and require continuous monitoring and remediation.
- Adopt an adaptive security architecture for protection from advanced threats using Gartner's 12 critical capabilities as the framework.
- Spend less on prevention; invest in detection, response and predictive capabilities.
- Favor context-aware network, endpoint and application security protection platforms from vendors that provide and integrate prediction, prevention, detection and response capabilities.
- Develop a security operations center that supports continuous monitoring and is responsible for the continuous threat protection process.
- Architect for comprehensive, continuous monitoring at all layers of the IT stack: network packets,  ows, OS activities, content, user behaviors and application transactions.

### Strategic Planning Assumptions
- By 2020, 60% of enterprise information security budgets will be allocated to rapid detection and response approaches — up from less than 10% in 2014.
- By 2020, 40% of enterprises will have established a security data warehouse — up from less than 5% in 2014.
- By 2018, 80% of endpoint protection platforms will include user activity monitoring and forensic capabilities — up from less than 5% in 2013.

### Introduction

Most enterprise security protection efforts and products have focused primarily on blocking and prevention techniques (such as antivirus) as well as on policy-based controls (such as  rewalls), to block threats (the upper-right quadrant of Figure 1). However, perfect prevention is impossible (see "Prevention Is Futile in 2020: Protect Information Via Pervasive Monitoring and Collective Intelligence"). Advanced targeted attacks are easily bypassing traditional  rewalls and signature- based prevention mechanisms. All organizations should now assume that they are in a state of continuous compromise. However, organizations have deluded themselves into believing that 100% prevention is possible, and they have become overly reliant on blocking-based and signature-based mechanisms for protection. As a result, most enterprises have limited capabilities to detect and
respond to breaches1 (the bottom half of Figure 1) when they inevitably occur, resulting in longer "dwell times" and increased damage.
In reality, going forward, improved prevention, detection, response and prediction capabilities are all needed to deal with all types of attacks, "advanced" or not (see Note 1). Furthermore, these should not be viewed as siloed capabilities; rather, they should work intelligently together as an integrated, adaptive system to constitute a complete protection process for advanced threats.
